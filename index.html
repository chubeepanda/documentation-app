      <header>Introduction</header>
      <p>
        Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability
        with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and
        first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a
        major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was
        the last release of Python 2.Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.

      <header>Design Philosophy and Features</header>

      <p>
        Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are
        fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming
        (including metaprogramming and metaobjects). Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design
        by contract and logic programming.
      </p>

      <p>
        Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for
        memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during
        program execution.
      </p>

      <code>
        Its design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce 
        functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules 
        (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML. Its core philosophy 
        is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:
      </code>

      <ul>
        <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
        <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
        <li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
        <li>Complex is better than complicated..</li>
        <li>Readability counts.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Syntax_and_Semantics">
      <header>Syntax and Semantics</header>

      <p>
        Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses
        English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly
        brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic
        exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Indentation</i>
        Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in
        indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current
        block.Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure. The recommended indent
        size is four spaces.
      </p>

      <p><i>Statements and control flow</i></p>
      <code>Python's statements include:</code>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The assignment statement, using a single equals sign =
        </li>
        <li>
          The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of
          else-if)
        </li>
        <li>
          The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for
          use by the attached block
        </li>
        <li>
          The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true
        </li>
        <li>
          The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by
          except clauses (or new syntax except* in Python 3.11 for exception groups[86]); it also ensures that clean-up
          code in a finally block is always run regardless of how the block exits
        </li>
      </ul>

      <code>Python's expressions include:</code>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The +, -, and * operators for mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication are similar to other
          languages, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python: floor division
          (or integer division) // and floating-point/division. Python uses the ** operator for exponentiation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Python uses the + operator for string concatenation. Python uses the * operator for duplicating a string a
          specified number of times.
        </li>
        <li>
          The @ infix operator. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.
        </li>
        <li>
          The syntax :=, called the "walrus operator", was introduced in Python 3.8. It assigns values to variables as
          part of a larger expression.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Python, == compares by value. Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison
          by reference), and comparisons may be chained—for example, a <= b <=c.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <i>Reference implementation</i>
        CPython is the reference implementation of Python. It is written in C, meeting the C89 standard (Python 3.11
        uses C11) with several select C99 features. CPython includes its own C extensions, but third-party extensions
        are not limited to older C versions—e.g. they can be implemented with C11 or C++. It compiles Python programs
        into an intermediate bytecode which is then executed by its virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a large
        standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python, and is available for many platforms, including
        Windows (starting with Python 3.9, the Python installer deliberately fails to install on Windows 7 and 8;
        Windows XP was supported until Python 3.5) and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1
        Macs, since Python 3.9.1, with experimental installer) and unofficial support for e.g. VMS. Platform portability
        was one of its earliest priorities.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Other implementations</i>
        PyPy is a fast, compliant interpreter of Python 2.7 and 3.8.
        Stackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads; it does not use the call stack
        in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs.
        MicroPython and CircuitPython are Python 3 variants optimized for microcontrollers, including Lego Mindstorms
        EV3.
        Pyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just-in-time compilation to speed up the execution of Python
        programs.
        Cinder is a performance-oriented fork of CPython 3.8 that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode
        inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time JIT, and an experimental bytecode compiler.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Unsupported implementations</i>
        Other just-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:

        Google began a project named Unladen Swallow in 2009, with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter
        fivefold by using the LLVM, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores, while
        ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock.
        Psyco is a discontinued just-in-time specializing compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode
        to machine code at runtime.
        PyS60 was a Python 2 interpreter for Series 60 mobile phones released by Nokia in 2005. It implemented many of
        the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the Symbian operating
        system.
      </p>

      <code>Cross-compilers to other languages</code>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Brython, Transcrypt and Pyjs (latest release in 2012) compile Python to JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cython compiles (a superset of) Python to C (while the resulting code is also usable with Python and also e.g. C++).
        </li>
        <li>
          Nuitka compiles Python into C.
        </li>
        <li>
          Numba uses LLVM to compile a subset of Python to machine code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pythran compiles a subset of Python 3 to C++ (C++11).
        </li>
      </ul>
